feature ideas:
- parameters that can be customized for each visualizer
- more visualizers
- add more post-processing effects other than bloom

issues:
- starfield bloom filter still doesn't seem quite right
- figure out better distribution of stars for starfield (Poisson disk sampling?)
- better video quality?
- fix duration for saved recording?
